title: "Ready, Set, Change! An Exploration of Agile Transformations" 
abstract: |
    A recent survey found that 94% of companies plan to adopt Agile in the next year. Astoundingly over 50% of all Agile transformations either fall short or fail outright. Where did they go wrong?
    <br/>
    Few organizations prepare themselves for the cultural and mindset shift that comes with Agile. Instead, they focus on the tactics. Worse yet, they utilize waterfall project management or antiquated OCM (organizational change management) techniques to transform. Itâ€™s the equivalent of a vegan chef running a steakhouse. 
    <br/>
    In this talk, we explore the motivations for Agile transformations; common pitfalls; and how to improve the likelihood of success.
