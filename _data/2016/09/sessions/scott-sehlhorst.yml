title: Problem Framing and Characterization
abstract: |
    As agile product managers, two of our challenges are to make good decisions around what is genuinely "good enough" for an MVP, and how to incrementally deliver a progressively "better" product.  It is rarely as simple as 'this feature, followed by that feature."  More commonly, the need is to deliver progressively better versions of solutions to particular problems.  How do you know which problems are "must have" problems, and which are problems where incremental improvement makes sense?  Then overlay this from a perspective of knowing what your market requires and what may differentiate your product from your competitors.
