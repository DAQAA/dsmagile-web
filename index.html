          <p>
            What keeps your best ideas from reaching escape velocity? Constraint come in many forms like process bloat, corporate hierarchies and bright shiny technologies are just a few gravity wells we face. If product and customer learning are the obvious target of uncertainty and value, why do we add baggage that inhibits learning and how does it keep sneaking in to our companies and teams? This talk will challenge you to examine which things you can jettison that allow for your innovations to lift off and move you towards your next best investment instead of being sucked down to planet old school, again.

          <p>
          The IT group at Western Governors University (WGU) was under incredible pressure. They were tasked with driving innovation, producing significant improvements in operational performance and building credibility – and do this nearly immediately while handling a complete application refresh and dealing with rapid growth. To produce the desired results, the group took a four-pronged approach: They used Agile to improve project results. They relied on Lean to improve internal processes. They rigorously aligned and rationalized the portfolio to the university and market. They created a culture of trust and ownership. The net result was a dramatic increase in throughput and innovation. In this session, Niel Nickolaisen explains the tools WGU used to transform IT.

          <h4><b>Metrics: Not Just for Managers Anymore</b></h4>
          <p>Scrum and metrics have not always gotten along. Usually, when metrics are brought up it is at a manager or executives request to see how a product is progressing and if the deadline and budget will be met, or worse, unmet/exceeded.</p>

          <p>Most of today's Agile Lifecycle Management (ALM) tools have a multitude of different metrics to show just about anything you can think of from burndowns to burnups, cycle time to work in progress and beyond. But do Scrum teams really know what these metrics mean and do management, ScrumMasters and the teams know how to properly utilize them to determine important trends to aid in inspection and adaption?</p>

          <p>Metrics: Not Just for Managers Anymore will explore how to teach teams to interpret and appreciate what their metrics are showing them. It will look at how to improve metrics by modifying practices and modify practices by improving the metrics.</p>
