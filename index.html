            <p>No one sets out to fail when they embark upon an Agile transformational journey.  Far too often however, the same failure patterns are visible, especially to practitioners who work with many organizations.  In this interactive session, we will discuss the top ten most common anti-patterns that threaten the success of enterprise Agility. We will also generate insights about the root causes - why these patterns emerge over and over again.  Following our session, you'll have the knowledge you'll need to diagnose these patterns, and some strategies for avoiding these ten mistakes you shouldn’t make.

            <p>Are you hungry? Eat this pre-processed, fast food hamburger!<br/>
Still hungry? Add a large order of French Fries!<br/>
<br/>
New to iterative software? Use Scrum!<br/>
Tired of Scrum? Use Kanban!<br/>
Got lots of teams? Use SAFe!<br/>
<br/>
We know a healthy diet values natural foods over the simplicity and ease of fast food. Similarly, many agile techniques are much more valuable than the simple, fast food version of software development everyone is teaching.
<br/>
<br/>
Over the last 15 years we started relying on other people's best practices instead of developing better ways of delivering software. We are using solutions developed for a different team, in a different decade, in a different company, in a different industry. There is such a rich tapestry of ways to build software and we are stuck eating software's version of fast food.
<br/>
<br/>
This interactive session discusses a bunch of different Agile techniques and when they are useful. Then we will look at just how different agile might be if we picked only the most appropriate items. Lastly, you will work with a few peers to determine if you need to swap a few techniques, or even build a personalized version of Agile, specially designed to help with your situation.

            <p>The Scrum Master role is a foundational concept of Scrum, yet like everything else, the role and it’s value should not be fixed. As with everything else related to agile, the nature of the Scrum Master role, and whether it is needed or all, depends a great deal on context.  As teams discover this, it leads to some common questions:

<li>What do Scrum Masters Really Do?</li>
<li>Do we even need Scrum Masters?</li>
<br/>
Join Jodi and Kent as we examine the Scrum Master role and attempt to answer the above questions.  We’ll share our experiences and give you a chance to share your perspectives with each other. By the end of the session, you'll have more insight into the Scrum Master role and how it applies (or not) to your situation.
<br/>
<br/>
After all, the only consistent answer to the above questions is “it depends”.

<br/> 
<br/> 
How often are demos something that add all that value? What about even adding any value? This session will give you the tools you need to make demos that don't suck.

            <p>We are not practicing the same Agile we did 15 years ago. Agile at scale is mainstream.  Thousands of companies are actively seeking information on how to scale agile effectively.  There are many frameworks and techniques but they all boil down to a set of common principles.  Agile done well involves teams, programs and portfolios in a way that aligns strategy and execution.  It's important to apply a proper team foundation to build things right but without agile applied at the program and portfolio level all we may end up with is the wrong things built faster.  In this talk Julie will discuss how to effectively apply Agile to your portfolios and programs to ensure you are also building the right things.  Learn to create value, not just process.

            <p>One of the major success factors in an agile transformation is helping teams take ownership: the teams own the solution. This requires Leaders learning how and when to step back (and when to step up.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Veritas NetBackup organization has tried agile transformations three times in the last seven years with the first two not succeeding and the third one going much better. The key difference has been the transformation of the Leaders to help teams take ownership as opposed to focusing only on the scrum artifacts and ceremonies. Moving from managers to Leaders is not an easy task. How did these Leaders learn? What did they learn? Join us to hear about NetBackup’s transformation story and some of the concepts and techniques that made the difference such as learning to be an enabler, how to ask questions and not give answers, and other tools.

            <p>We hear it all the time: face-to-face communication is best. Co-located teams are more collaborative, more productive, more manageable. Pair programming is more efficient than code review. Mob programming—literally the whole team around one screen—may be even more efficient. This session won't try to argue that these statements aren't true in the moment, but rather that these optimizations achieve a local maximum. We will explore the limitations of co-location, and discuss distributed communication patterns that can help even mostly co-located teams achieve their global maximum.

Teams that moved from heavily documented process to light, to executable examples and exploration, and, for some, one-piece flow and continuous delivery tend to experiment with technique — some techniques seem to work, and others, not so much. <br/> <br/> Come benefit from the experience of others as we discuss a move to a fluency model for Agile-Testing, with real examples.

            <p>Over the past few years there’s been a push in the product development world to “make products that people love”. While many companies focus on having the best design and the greatest experience, they are still missing the most important step in product development – learning about their customers.
<br/>
<br/>
The popularity of Agile and Lean has sparked discussions about getting software out faster to users. At the core of this has been the Minimum Viable Product. Unfortunately, many people still do not understand the MVP. Some see it as a way to release a product faster. Others are scared of it, viewing it as a way to put broken code on your site and ruin products.
<br/>
<br/>
The sole purpose of Minimum Viable Product is to learn about your customers. This step that has been so overlooked and yet it is the most essential part to creating a product your customers will love. The more information you can uncover through experimentation, the more certainty there is about building the right thing. In this talk, Melissa will go over how to design the most effective product experimentations to learn about your customer, their problems, and how to solve them. She’ll explain how to get the rest of the organization on board with this method of testing, and how to incorporate it into overall Product Strategy.

            <p>As agile product managers, two of our challenges are to make good decisions around what is genuinely "good enough" for an MVP, and how to incrementally deliver a progressively "better" product.  It is rarely as simple as 'this feature, followed by that feature."  More commonly, the need is to deliver progressively better versions of solutions to particular problems.  How do you know which problems are "must have" problems, and which are problems where incremental improvement makes sense?  Then overlay this from a perspective of knowing what your market requires and what may differentiate your product from your competitors.

            <p>We have at the seen teams evolve in line with original agile principles and modern technologies to be more exciting, more capable, more helpful, and ever more lean. 
<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, other organizations have evolved their agile practice away from the original values and principles through a series of compromises, until it has become a lifeless set of formalities.  
<br/>
<br/>
We realized that the most deeply, impressively agile teams we know seem to have connected on four values.
<br/>
<br/>
They make people awesome, deliver value continuously, and experiment and learn rapidly. These challenging changes are only possible because of the safety that permeates their practices and culture. 
<br/>
<br/>
Come for a re-think of agility and a challenge that may transform your experience of software development.
